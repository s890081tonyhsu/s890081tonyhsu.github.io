# Interactive Webpage of I Ching Divination

A simple horary program that completes horary preparations through specific interactive actions.

The divination behavior is based on the parameters of manual intervention provided by the questioner as the basis, and the general direction answer is obtained through the correlation between the follow-up parameters and the question. This program uses the three random bits on the screen provided by the user as parameters to generate answers to the user\'s questions.
